# WSL 🍻

> I LOVE WSL!

I like windows's UI simple I can do jobs faster than mac and adding linux terminal on that is perfect work environment for me.

Some benefist of this setup:

- Use new windows terminal (best terminal ever) setting default terminal to wsl
- Run docker under wsl
- Vscode and see the wsl file system
- View Linux gui apps under wsl
- Runnable .exe files from terminal

There is still some cons, need to much more flexibility of the wsl machine like networking, passthrough devices.
